We will talk about Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which is a useful tool in theoretical computer science, combinaorics and more. We will start with basic concepts, such as influences, noise sensitivity, and hypercontractivitiy and some basic results in the area. 

Depending on time, we will also discuss applications in fields such as hardness of approximation and extremal combinatorics, as well as more recent developments. 

Most of the course will be based on a book by Ryan O'Donnell, which is available at amazon but also has a free online version at [http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/)  

 

Lectures: Tuesday & Thursday, 9:30 - 11:00 EST. 

The [book](http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.net/)  

[Links to an external site.](http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.net/) by Ryan O'Donnell will cover much of the material we will see in the course. 

Similar courses have been given in [Berkeley](http://www.avishaytal.org/cs294-analysis-of-boolean-functions)  

[Links to an external site.](http://www.avishaytal.org/cs294-analysis-of-boolean-functions), [Technion Links to an external site.](https://yuvalfilmus.cs.technion.ac.il/courses/?crid=615), [CMU Links to an external site.](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/aobf12/) among other places. 

Course grade: 

The final grade in the course will be composed of the grades in the problem sets given throughout the semester (50%), and a final project (50%).  

Problem sets: 

*Starred and non-starred problems:* 

The problem sets will often contain problems of normal difficulty, as well as some that may be more challenging and will be marked with a star (\*). Solving all normal difficulty problems is enough in order to get an A-, but to get an A or A+ requires solving a substantial number of starred problems. 

*Collaboration:* 

(1) You are highly encouraged to think about and solve the problems by your own. However, discussing the problems is allowed within reason (i.e. not just sharing your solutions). In any case of collaboration, please mention in your submission the names of people that you have collaborated with, individually for each problem. 

(2) You may not look up solutions to homework problems online or offline. 

*Submission* 

(1) Solution to problem sets are to be typed in LATEX and submitted as a PDF file. Please name your file as ps#\_Lastname\_Firstname.pdf, and remember to include your name in each file. 

(2) The submission deadline for each problem set will be mentioned in the problem set itself. Late submission will result in penalized score of 20% reduction per day. That is, a submission late in 2 days that is graded x points will actually be given 0.6 x points. 

Final project: 

The final project in the course will involve reading a research-level paper and either summarizing it or giving a short presentation, depending on the amount of students that will take the course for credit. This may include pointing out to related open research directions and making some progress along them.
