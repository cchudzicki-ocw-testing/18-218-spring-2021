#### Course Description

In this course, we will mostly be studying  Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which is a useful tool in theoretical computer science, combinatorics and more. We will start with basic concepts, such as influences, noise sensitivity, and hypercontractivity and some basic results in the area. 

Depending on time, we will also discuss applications in fields such as hardness of approximation and extremal combinatorics, as well as more recent developments. 

Most of the course will be based on a book by Ryan O'Donnell, which is available to purchase but also has a free online version at [http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/)  

 

The [book](http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.net/)  

[Links to an external site.](http://analysisofbooleanfunctions.net/) by Ryan O'Donnell will cover much of the material we will see in the course. 

Similar courses have been given in [Berkeley](http://www.avishaytal.org/cs294-analysis-of-boolean-functions)  

[Links to an external site.](http://www.avishaytal.org/cs294-analysis-of-boolean-functions), [Technion Links to an external site.](https://yuvalfilmus.cs.technion.ac.il/courses/?crid=615), [CMU Links to an external site.](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/aobf12/) among other places. 

#### Grading

The final grade in the course will be composed of the grades in the problem sets given throughout the semester (50%), and a final project (50%).  

 

Final project: 

The final project in the course will involve reading a research-level paper and either summarizing it or giving a short presentation, depending on the amount of students that will take the course for credit. This may include pointing out to related open research directions and making some progress along them.
